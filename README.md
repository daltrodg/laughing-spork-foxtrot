# laughing-spork-foxtrot

This webpage is to show my dev skills and other career things. 
I have many links to different things like my Github and a link to this repo along with a link to my codepen. 
I have a bootstrap card that makes use of a picture and has the text overlaid onto the image. The page also includes a picture of myself.
First project where moving things around was a huge part of the organization and making things look cool. Was fun to move things around and guess on the first try to see where the element would end up on the page.
All links have target="_blank" 

Wireframe is included in the files listed in the repo.
